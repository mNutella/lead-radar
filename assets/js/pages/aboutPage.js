      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Boooom is a curated list of leadership job opportunities for designers.
        We want to help great designers connect with great companies.
      </p>
      <h3>A network of partners and sponsors</h3>
      <p className="notes">
        Our audience is primarily composed of designers looking for opportunities in
        leadership and management roles. They are usually not in a hurry,
        but will act fast if the perfect opportunity comes by.
        New visitors come here mainly by reference from their peers or
        organically through specialized design communities and media outlets.
        Monthly, we post dozens of job opportunities in awesome companies from all over the world.

        We foster partnerships with key communities, organizations and
        events to help the advancement of the discipline.
        By showing the value of design for business,
        design management and leadership becomes a strategic asset for organizations.
        Many leadership roles are filled off-market just by reference,
        taking several months, just because there wasn’t an efficient way to get to this audience.
        Not anymore.
